Solutions to Baez and Muniain's "Gauge Fields, Knots and Gravity".
==================

A while back I wrote a short [review](https://complementaryslackness.wordpress.com/2009/02/01/book-review-gauge-fields-knots-and-gravity/) of this book, an introduction to these topics and the mathematics behind them. The nickel version is that you should put down what youâ€™re doing and purchase this book immediately.

At some point I started doing a majority of the exercises in the book, even typing them up in LaTeX. Eventually I got a tablet computer and started writing them up in Xournal. I ran out of steam somewhere around Chern-Simons theory, but posted what I had on my website. I'm moving them over to this repository in the hope that you may be interested in contributing your solutions as well.
